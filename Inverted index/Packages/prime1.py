prime1 = "raw Etheric Senses / Consecration. Infuse Personal Quintessence.\nA beginning study of Prime allows the mage to perceive and channel Quintessence from Nodes, Tass, Wonders, and magickal Effects.\nShe may spot energetic ebbs and flows, can sense and at least try to read Resonance and Synergy signatures, and could also absorb Quintessence into her personal Pattern.\nMages without at least one dot in Prime cannot absorb Quintessence beyond their Avatar Background rating.\nA Prime-skilled mage, however, may do so. When infusing her Quintessence into an object, that mage may also consecrate the object with her personal energy.\nWhen she shapeshifts, steps sideways, or otherwise alters her Pattern’s metaphysical nature, that consecrated object will then change with her.\nIn the process, it also picks up her personal Resonance… which, because it both identifies her and becomes essentially connected to her, is not always a good thing."
